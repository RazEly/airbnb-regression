Unbeatable location 100% of guests in the past year gave this location a 5-star rating. Free cancellation before November 15 Get a full refund if you change your mind. Are you looking for a longer stay? Our guest house is a beautifully fitted out, self contained cottage set away from the main house, surrounded by lush gardens. Perfect for longer stays and ideal for creatives, it has private parking, a garden + access to a shared gym. Relax in the Japanese soaking tub, read by the bio stove or focus on your work in the light filled work/dining space, then sit in your private garden to watch the sun go down. (Suitable for guests who are less mobile, see listing) The space Our guest house sits at the top of our garden, adjacent to a barn which houses a pottery studio and gym/games room. It is a fully self contained building designed for longer stays, offering all the amenities you would need to cater for yourself long term: a fully fitted kitchen (microwave/oven combi, fridge, dishwasher, gas hob), bathroom (shower and bath) and utility (washing machine and tumble dryer). The wardrobe in the main bedroom is substantial and there is hanging space in the utility for the second bedroom which houses an adult size bunk bed. The generous dining table and cosy dining bench are lit up beautifully by a south facing skylight. Perfect for all meals but also to work, making use of the fast Starlink internet provided. The building is exceptionally healthy and calming, with natural, breathable clay plaster walls, solid oak surfaces, wood wool insulation, natural ventilation and plenty of light. Wooden shutters and sliding doors provide privacy and acoustic separation when needed. Underfloor heating ensures the building is comfortable at all times and a bio stove offers extra cosyness in winter. If you want to escape the big smoke, write a novel, compose a song, clear your mind or just enjoy hearing the birds sing, this is the perfect place for you! (Suitable for the less mobile, all rooms flow into each other with step free openings of 80 and 90cm respectively. A mobile ramp is available for the entrance step into the building and the parking space is generous. Assistance is needed as bathroom and kitchen fittings are not compliant but overall the building is very accessible.) Guest access The building is entirely yours during your stay, and so are the terraces (east and south) as well as the back garden, which is accessible from the main bedroom. We allow guests access to our gym with the use of all the equipment provided, including a Peloton tread, provided they agree to the terms and conditions prior to use. There is a separate pottery studio adjacent to the gym which is usually locked and for private use only. However, experienced potters on long term stays can arrange access and use the space and pottery classes for beginners can be arranged upon request. We offer a private parking bay within our covered garage as well as space for a second car within the gravel drive. The drive is secured by electronic gates for which a buzzer will be provided for the duration of your stay. We are very near the A23 (luckily not within ear shot) which makes us easy to reach from both London and Brighton (90 and 30 minutes respectively). Places to enjoy within a 10-15 minute drive are: - Bolney Wine Estate - Ardingly reservoir - Wakehurst, Nymans and Borde Hill Gardens - The Spa at South Lodge - Leonardslee - JoCo Balcombe (our local cafe, a good starting point for walks) - Country walks - Country pubs - and many more A 20 minute drive takes you to the beautiful South Downs. Balcombe Station, which is just 5 minutes down the road, has a car park that is free of charge on weekends but gets busy with commuters during the week. Trains to London run twice per hour. Other things to note We kindly ask our guests to use the garden dedicated to the guest house and not our main garden. You will find that there is plenty of distance between the two. You can make full use of the wrap around terrace around the guest house, including the large swing on our oak tree and the hammock outside the barn. Please refrain from using the small terrace outside the pottery studio as this is used as layout space for pottery items. If you plan to arrive by train and take a taxi to our address, please alight at Three Bridges Station. The fair will be around \u00a320 and taxis are usually available outside the station. There are no taxis at Balcombe Station and no buses pass our address. You could cycle but local roads are narrow and dangerous for cyclists so we really would not recommend this. The nearest petrol station is Pease Pottage (6 miles) and the closest supermarket is Budgens in Handcross (4 miles). Sainsbury's, Argos and Waitrose are nearby in Crawley/Haywards Heath (10 miles).
