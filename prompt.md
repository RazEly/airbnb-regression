the extraction of data using parser.py is both inefficient and often incorrect. there are many missing values that are imputed.
I downloaded multiple airbnb listings and saved them in @examples i want you to test each one of them to see how well the extraction works. suggest improvements to the parser.py . add tests to make sure that there is actual improvements in comparison to the current version.
The structure of the listings is quite similar and so simple regex should work fine.
Make a list of all the features that SHOULD be extracted based on the model, and start from there.
Features that are extracted but not used in the model shouldnt be parsed from the webpage.


The entire project contains legacy code that is no longer used. create A comprehensive plan to reduce the code size without changing the performance. The process should be very careful. We don't want to remove any code that is actually being used in production. We don't want to remove any code that is actually being used in production.


The comments on many of the files are redundant and excessive. Make them way more compact, yet still informative.
